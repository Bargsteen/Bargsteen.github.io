Overview:
Intro
Show multiplication example
What we need to know:
  - Some definitions and laws that build upon each other
  - Addition definition:
      - Counting principle
      - First law: commutative
      - *** + ** = ** + *** => a + b = b + a
  - Multiplication definition
      - Based on addition, and thereby counting
      - a groups of b
      - ***  
        *** = 3 groups of 2, or 2 groups of 3. Commutative law again!
  - Distributive law
      - Multiplication can be done in parts, and then combined
        *****   =   *** + **
        *****   =   *** + **
        2 x (3 + 2) = 2 x 3 + 2 x 2
      - This is the distributive law, and the second last piece of the puzzle!
      - Works for any split:
        ****** = ***** + * = **** + ** = *** + ***
        ****** = ***** + * = **** + ** = *** + ***
      - and from the commutative law, we know that **** + ** = ** + ****
  - Positional number system
      - Last piece: understanding our number system.
      - Roman numerals: 
          - XXV, all X's = 10, All V's = 5.
          - Subtraction rule: write IV instead of IIII. 
            - Still, each letter always represents the same amount.
            - How to write 11 thousand in Roman? MMMMMMMMMMM. Not very efficient.
          - Positional number system: 33, these 3's are not equal!
          - Means: 3 x 10 ^ 1 + 3 x 10 ^ 0. (for any number x, x^0 = 1)
  - Putting it all together:
      - 12 * 3 = ************  = ** + **********
                 ************  = ** + **********
                 ************  = ** + **********
      - We can split this! 3 x (2 + 10) = 3 x 2 + 3 x 10
