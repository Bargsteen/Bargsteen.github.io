# Hold on, Marseille! We're coming over
### 15/07 - Chapter Six
Sleeping with your friends by the lake, doesn't that just sound idyllic? Like something out of a fairy tale about two guys hitchhiking to France.<br />
I woke up with a mild hangover and sneaked out of the tent. The others were still asleep, and I went for a morning swim in the lovely water. <br />
A little later, our friends, the strangers, cooked us a nice breakfast and brewed some extremely strong coffee. If you aren't awake after such a cup, then something is surely wrong with you!<br /> 
We packed our gear and headed for a gas station on a highway. The route was quite scenic due to being primarily inside this regional park. When we reached the gas station we joked about how fast we could get a ride. GaÃ«tan and Hortense had given us some tips about the license plates and their corresponding regions - so we knew what to look for. I went for a quick trip to the bathroom only to find Dei with a ride ready to go when I came back. Unbelievable, I was gone like two minutes :D We said our goodbyes and were then on our way towards the south of France. <br />
A few hours later we were dropped off at another gas station, where we would soon find Irene, who not only gave us a ride - but also a roof.
