# Aalborg to Hannover in One Ride!
### 10/07 - Chapter One

This is the story, or misadventure if you will, of two unlikely comrades and their travels from the cold and rainy land of Denmark to the far warmer and sunny land of France.
The heroes of this story are Kasper 'Dizzy' Dissing Bargsteen and Deimantas 'Diama' Jurevičius.

We started off in Aalborg around noon, and we quickly found a car going south. They were, in fact, two German bus drivers going, in their private car, to Hannover in Germany. Awesome. And on we went!
On the way we saw a bit of Hamburg - I mean, really, just the tip!

So here we were, at a gas station just north of Hannover. Goodbyes were said to our lovely hosts on wheels, and we even had the time to take a quick group photo with them. Although someone had to hold the camera...

The sun was setting, and we were quite pleased with our hitchhiking effort so far. We had our tent and used an old timey map to find our path to the nearest town (or Google Maps - whatever you'd like to believe). On our journey, we saw many things and tasted many treats.

We set up our camp in a small park in the city of ~~*&#91;insert extremely German sounding name of a town&#93;*~~ Schwarmstedt. Tonight's dinner was cooked on Dizzy's travel stove and it consisted of couscous and other ingredients!

And so the dinner was served, eaten, enjoyed, and accompanied by several proper German beers! Thus ends the first chapter of *The Misadventures of Dizzy and Diama*. Stay tuned for more!
