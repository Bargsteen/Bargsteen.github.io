- Intro
 - I work at Concordium, mostly on smart contracts
 - We've been working on the next version of our smart contracts
   - Sync calls + state changes (prefix trie)
 - The next version will be released with a protocol update on the chain in May
 - But here is a preview of one of the two primary changes
   - Sync calls
 - Changes are best understood in relation to our previous version (v0) and a
   very realistic problem!
- A realistic problem
- Solved with a v0 Smart Contract
- Solved with a v1 Smart Contract
