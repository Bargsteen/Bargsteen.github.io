I released a new song, called Sporadic Contemplation!
And you can listen to right here:

I created the basis of the tune in one afternoon last year.
The first part added was the synth parts in the intro.
I generated the chords using Ableton Live's Arpeggiator, Random, Scale
and Chord plugins.

{% figure "/img/sporadic-contemplation/ableton_live_plugins.png" "Generating random chords in the key of F major" %}

This allowed me to generate a large sequence of random chords in the key of
F-major.
It works like this:
- The arpeggiator creates a single MIDI node at a set interval (quarter notes)
- The chord plugin will then add additional nodes on top of this to create a
chord (this will always be a major add9 chord with these settings)
- To vary the type of chords generated, the random plugin takes each of the
  nodes of the major add9 chord and transforms it into another random node
  (which might be in another key)
- Each of these nodes are then forced into the nearest node that fits in the F
  major scale via the Scale plugin
- And voila! You get a random sequence of interesting chords in F major

With this setup, I then recorded a long sequence of random chords, listened
through them and found a good section.
I edited the section slightly, which was easy to do, as it was MIDI.
Then I looped the section and I had the basis of my song!

Next up, I added a drum loop, found some choir vocals on
[freesound.org](https://www.freesound.org), recorded a guitar solo and then called it a day!

And that's it. Let me know what you think of the tune. Especially the mixing and
mastering, which is somewhat new territory to me.

Until next time,
