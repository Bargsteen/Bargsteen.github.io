# Paris, my Paris!
### 12/07 - Chapter Three
Today was a wild day. We slept in a park, went to Paris, drank, ate, saw, and photographed! The videoes and photos explain it quite well, so I'll let them do most of the talking this time around. As they say: "A picture is worth a thousand words", and those videos are 2:05 minutes long in total. Which means 125 seconds &#42; 30 frames per sec &#42; 1000 words per pic = 3.750.000 words. So I think we are covered. Anyway, we saw the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, the Latino Area and plenty more. We even Frenched it up by walking around in the streets with a bottle of wine. Good times! Oh, and we got a super nice room in a hostel with two beds. We were set! Aaand, I'll hand it off to the videoes and witty comments underneath the photos:

{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/louvre.jpg" "Tha house"  %}
{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/louvre_pyramid_bw.jpg" "Classic black and white to seem artsy!"  %}
{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/poser_girl_one.jpg" "Some girls were posing, and the light was good. What can you do.. (Poser Girl One)"  %}
{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/poser_girl_two.jpg" "Poser Girl Two"  %}
{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/poser_girl_three.jpg" "Poser Girl Three"  %}
{% figure "/img/misadventures/three/seine.jpg" "Long exposure to round off the night"  %}

And thus ends the third chapter of The Misadventures of Dizzy and Diama. Media-driven right? Who likes to read anyway! Good night, and stay hungry. (oh that burger, was sooo good!).
